# ChemBERT_Eval (split from your original Full_code_ChemBERT.py)

This folder contains your original code, split into small modules without changing variable names or logic.

- `dataset.py`  — your Dataset class (`class_ls`)
- `model_cnn.py` — your CNN model class (`CNN_Class`)
- `chem_utils.py` — your RDKit helper (`calculate_molecular_formula`)
- `main.py` — the rest of your original script (procedural pipeline), importing the pieces above

## How to run
```bash
python main.py
```
(Use the same working directory and file paths as in your original script.)
